# Liam Robertson's Portfolio

## Project Description
This portfolio website will showcase my work and talent as a web developer to future employers and friends.

## Usage
This portfolio has a functioning navigation bar with clickable links, a banner section with a picture of myself, an about me section that will be more descriptive at a later date, a work section that will showcase my future projects that blurs and unblurs depending on the mouse hover, and finally a functioning contact section with clickable links to my github and linkedin.
**More feature coming soon!**
